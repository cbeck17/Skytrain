OPEN THE SKYTRAIN2_04.PDE (it might take a minute or two to open)


General - This game is still in the development phase and does not have an active
game controller that will allow the user to play the game. If you maximize the screen,
you can see that there are actually three planes available for selection on screen, but due to
changes I want to make in the game to make it slightly less complicated, I had to remake
all of the movement methods and therefore, planes do not always work (the twin otter works). The 
GUI background is already created and is visible as the background of the appilcation, however 
the opening title screen, credits (for music), and closing screens are not yet part of the 
appilcation because they need to be controlled by the controller class which I have not yet 
had the chance to create (the airplane classes need to be completed first).

Documents - In the document folder, you can find the text file for my documentation statement,
and my revisions log (it's relatively new, so it is not comprehensive).

Instructions - Planes are selectable on screen using the mouse. Hover over the airplane and it
will highlight green, click the plane to select it. A selected plane will be highlighted blue. 
Planes that are selected will have options associated with them that appear in the lower left-hand 
corner of the GUI. To direct the plane, select the appropriate option when selected. When the
controller is built, the game play will present a limited number of towplanes, sailplanes, IPs,
and students. The player will attempt to get as many students airborne as possible in one 'day' (level).
Challenges will be presented when students take longer than normal to load into a sailplane,
towplanes run low on fuel, runways fill up, or if the player is doing too well, the twin otter
might go rogue and strafe the airfield.

The twin otter is fully functional. If you want to test the movement methods, start there. The 
sailplane and towplane are still being revised! If you would like proof that the methods are written
for the other aircraft, I can submit a Skytrain v1.9 or earlier build and it should demonstrate
the proper movement methods for the towplanes and sailplanes.
